Welcome to FluidSim's documentation!
====================================

FluidSim is a framework for studying fluid dynamics with numerical
simulations using Python. It is part of the wider project `FluidDyn
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fluiddyn/>`_.

The package is still in a planning stage so it is still pretty
unstable and many of its planned features have not yet been
implemented.
